Udacity - Project 2 - Data Analysis Nanodegree.

## About this Project

This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, a dataset was provided by Gapminder World and displays information regarding how people live their lives in different countries. There are several indicators available, and in this analysis, three were selected: Life Expectancy in years, Child mortality per 1000 born and income per person in dollars. The following questions will be addressed after the Assessing and Cleaning data processes.

  - What is the correlation between Life Expectancy and Child Mortality?
  - How did Child Mortality evolve in the six continents?
  - Which continent has the lowest percentage change in Child Mortality?
  - What is the correlation between Life Expectancy and Income Per Person?
  - How Income Per Person evolve in Europe in comparison to the Americas?
  - By how much did Child Mortality reduce in the Americas.
